## Wandertale:

I'm working on a grid based tactics roleplaying game I'm tentatively calling Wandertale in my spare time.

I'll periodically post updates on the state of the game development, thoughts about mechanics and game design, and so on. Look forward to it!

## About Me:

I'm a software engineer with a background in computer science, math, and informatics. I'm a researcher at an aerospace corporation, and I work on a variety of projects and play video games in my spare time.

I've historically been bad about keeping my portfolio up to date with my current projects, so it's safe to assume that things here aren't necessarily up to date (or complete, given my job).

## Other Projects:

* <https://github.com/StanWarford/pep8>
* <https://github.com/StanWarford/pep8cpu>
* <https://github.com/StanWarford/pep9suite>
* <https://github.com/StanWarford/pep10suite>

...as well as a bunch of internal closed-source (ðŸ˜”) projects at work, including:
* software for controlling an autonomous alt-az telescope
* prototypes for various cloud/cloud-based capabilities

## Cats:

My cats, Zarya and Tracer, are the absolute best. Zarya is a Russian Blue, and Tracer is an American Rowdyboy who has recently been tamed with the power of brushies. Check out their [âœ¨Instagramâœ¨](https://www.instagram.com/zarya.dimpfl/)!
